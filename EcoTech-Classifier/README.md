# WCE Hackathon - EcoTech Classifier

## Welcome to the ML Classifier Repo for EcoTech

#### EcoTech is a mobile app for reporting E-Waste effeciently and thereby reducing the damage to the environment cauesd by the E-Waste

#### Ecotech is based on a business model which makes it sustainable both for the earth and money wise

#### We use this ML Image Classifier as a first layer filter for identification of e-waste

#### Lets get started with training and verifying the model

```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
foo@bar:~$ python model.py
```

Caution: We have not uploaded the images we have used as it is quite a large dataset in terms of storage space.
But for testing if the model works or not, you can create a directory 'dataset' with two sub directories 'ewaste' and 'not_ewaste' and run the model.

We have attached a copy of the previous run of the ml model in a pdf which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/EcoTech-WCE-Hackathon/EcoTech-Classifier/blob/master/model.pdf)

#### Thank You very much for following along.
